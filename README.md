# **Object Writer**

This is a very small project I made to save myself some time while doing Object Writing.

>_Object writing is a writing exercise that focuses on describing an object and any related experiences, using all of your senses. I originally learned about object writing from brilliant lyric guru Pat Pattison._

All this program does is generate a word (from a given .txt file), and give you a timer.

Upon running, it immediately opens up Notepad with the word as a title and starts the timer.

Your files are saved in a folder, so you can look back at what you've written and see your own progress.

You can also use the **settings.txt** file to change the timer, the file from which to pick words, the path where your files are saved, and how the file names are generated.

I made this for myself but I'm glad to share. The file with all the words to pick from (**words.txt**) is not the best, but it gets the job done.
